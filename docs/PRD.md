# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
**MealMeter**

## Product Overview
MealMeter is a restaurant feedback application that allows patrons to provide structured feedback about their dining
experience directly at the point of sale.

The application enables customers to rate key aspects of their visit and leave written comments that help restaurants
understand customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

The system collects ratings in three primary categories:

- Food quality
- Cleanliness
- Service

In addition to ratings, patrons must submit a short written review describing their experience.
This information is recorded and made available to the restaurant for analysis and service improvement.

## Problem Statement
Restaurants rely heavily on customer satisfaction to maintain their reputation and attract repeat customers. However, many establishments struggle to collect structured feedback from patrons during or immediately after their dining experience.

Current feedback mechanisms such as online review platforms often suffer from several limitations:

- Feedback is delayed or forgotten after customers leave the restaurant
- Reviews are often unstructured and challenging to analyse
- Restaurants may not receive feedback until long after the dining experience
- Restaurants may not be able to distinguish genuine reviews from bad-faith actors leaving review bombs

This project aims to provide restaurants with a simple and immediate way to collect meaningful feedback from patrons directly at the point of sale.

## Target Users / Stakeholders
- Restaurant Patrons
- Restaurant Owners
